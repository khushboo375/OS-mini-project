    <!-- Section 3: What is Deadlock -->
    <div class="section">

                            <p><b>Definition: </b>The Mutual Exclusion condition implies that a resource can only be held by one process at a time. No two processes can share the same resource simultaneously. If a process is holding a resource, no other process can access it until it is released.</p>
                            <p><b>Importance in Deadlock: </b>This condition is necessary for deadlock to occur because if resources were shared, deadlock could not happen. Each resource must be exclusive to a single process.</p>

                            <p><b>Definition:</b> The Hold and Wait condition occurs when a process is holding one or more resources and is waiting to acquire additional resources that are currently held by other processes.</p>
                            <p><b>Importance in Deadlock:</b> This condition creates a situation where a process may hold a resource and block others from obtaining the resources they need to complete their tasks, potentially leading to a circular wait, which is a necessary condition for deadlock.</p>

                            <p><b>Definition: </b>The No Preemption condition states that once a process has been allocated a resource, the operating system cannot forcibly take it away from the process, even if other processes are waiting for that resource.</p>
                            <p><b>Importance in Deadlock:</b>If resources cannot be preempted, it becomes possible for processes to hold resources indefinitely while waiting for other resources, causing a potential deadlock situation.</p>

                            <p><b>Definition: </b>The Circular Wait condition exists when a set of processes are each waiting for a resource that is held by another process in the set, forming a circular chain of waiting processes. Each process in the circle is waiting for a resource held by the next process, creating a deadlock.</p>
                            <p><b>Importance in Deadlock: </b>This condition is the final piece that completes the deadlock scenario. If a circular wait exists, deadlock is inevitable because each process is blocked and unable to release the resources it holds to resolve the wait.</p>

                    </div>

            </span></li>

        <p>To avoid deadlocks, operating systems use algorithms like the Banker's Algorithm, resource ordering, or timeout-based handling mechanisms.</p>

    <!-- Section 4: How the Simulator Works -->
    <div class="section">
        <h2>How the Banker's Algorithm Simulator Works</h2>
        <p>The Banker's Algorithm Simulator helps visualize how processes and resources interact to avoid deadlock. After entering the number of processes and resources, the simulator generates resource matrices and calculates the Need Matrix and Available Resources. It checks if processes can safely execute based on available resources, marking them as safe or waiting. If at least one of the process is in waiting state for infinite time it means there is a deadlock.. The simulation tracks progress through an execution log, using color-coded visuals to indicate safe or waiting processes, demonstrating how the Banker's Algorithm ensures deadlock-free execution.</p>
